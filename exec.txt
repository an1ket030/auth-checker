Step 1: Open VS Code
Launch VS Code.

Make sure it opens your project folder: D:\Projects\auth-checker.

If not, go to File -> Open Folder and select D:\Projects\auth-checker.

Step 2: Start the Backend (Terminal 1)
You need a terminal to run the Python server.

Open a Terminal (Ctrl + ~).

Activate the Virtual Environment:

PowerShell

.\venv\Scripts\activate
(You should see (venv) appear at the start of the line).

Start the Server:

PowerShell

uvicorn backend.server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
Wait until you see: Application startup complete.

Keep this terminal OPEN. Do not close it.

Step 3: Start the App (Terminal 2)
You need a second terminal to run the mobile app.

Click the + icon (or split icon) in the terminal panel to open a new terminal.

Go to the app folder:

PowerShell

cd app
Check your IP Address (Crucial Step):

Since you reconnected to Wi-Fi, your IP might have changed.

Run ipconfig.

Copy the IPv4 Address (e.g., 10.154.x.x).

Open App.js and update line 19: const API_URL = 'http://YOUR_NEW_IP:8000/api/v1';

Save the file (Ctrl + S).

Start the App:

PowerShell

npx expo start -c
Step 4: Connect Phone
Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone.

Shake the phone to reload if needed.

Login and start scanning!
